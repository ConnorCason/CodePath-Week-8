# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/SQL.gif)

In the 'Find Salesperson' tab, if you click on a specific person, and enter your injection as the php id, it will be executed by Globtek. As you can see, by changing the sleep timer from 5 to 10 we cause the page to reload at different speeds, indicating that our injecting has in fact been executed.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/session.gif)

By logging in on red or green, we can determine the seesion ID and change the current seesion ID of the blue site to the ID generated by the red or green site in order to bypass the login on blue.


## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/User_Enum.gif)

Usernames that are not recognized by the system appear in standard type, whereas usernames that are recognized by Globtek but contain the wrong password are bolded. This allows an attacker confirm if a specific username is present in the database.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/XSS.gif)

Without logging in, you can insert a payload script in the feedback section as the input has not been sanitized properly by the source code. When an admin logs in and views the feedback, the script containing an alert message is displayed, showcasing the vulerability.



## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/IDOR.gif)

If you click the 'Find Salesperson' tab, you will notice that the URL contains a php id number. By manually altering the id in the URL, you are able to access (at least) two employee pages that were not meant to be public.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://github.com/ConnorCason/CodePath-Week-8/blob/master/CSRF.gif)

The red site does not validate CSRF token correctly, and allows users without proper permission to edit other user profiles without confirming through the token that they do in fact have that privalige.
